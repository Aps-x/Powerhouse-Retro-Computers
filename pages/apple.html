                The Apple II was the second personal computer circuit design to come from Steve Wozniak (one of Apple's 
                founders). Wozniak again produced an elegant and efficient circuit design with a colour video output (the 
                first mass-market personal computer to do so). Although the Apple II launched without any compelling 
                applications it was a design that, as Steve Job's had hoped, would appeal to software writers and 
                developers. The availability of Visicalc for the Apple II within months of its release helped propel sales 
                of the Apple II ten fold year on year through the late 1970s.

                The Apple II provided a steady and growing stream of revenue throughout the late 1970s to the end of the 
                1980s. This revenue was particularly important to sustaining Apple's existence through protracted periods 
                of research and development and product failures - in particular the Apple III and Lisa. Macintosh sales 
                displaced the pre eminence of the Apple II in the late 1980s.

                The Apple Monitor II was late to arrive on the scene (1982) however the longevity of the Apple II resulted 
                in its continued manufacture through the late 1980s. Prior to its release most Apple II users fed the video 
                output from the computer to whatever screen was available (Television set, generic monitor). The Monitor II 
                enjoyed brisk sales as Apple II users embraced it as complementary to the Apple II case.

                            The Apple II was the second computer to come from Apple Computer Incorporated. The Apple II went 
                            into production in April 1977. The Apple Monitor II was designed and released in 1982 nearly five 
                            years after the Apple II. It was purposely built to complement the Apple II. The Apple II was made 
                            in Ireland. The Apple II Monitor was made by Samsung, Korea for Apple Computer Inc.

                            The elegant circuit which improved upon the Apple I was designed by Steven Wozniak and Steve Jobs 
                            had the task of managing the design of the computers housing. After doing the rounds of design 
                            consultancies in the (Silicon) Valley Jobs was recommended Jerry Manock who had only recently gone 
                            freelance. After graduating from the Stanford Product Design Program Manock went to work for Hewlett
                            Packard (HP) where he was involved in the design of esoteric instruments for the microwave division
                            . He left HP in 1972 and had produced a electronic aids for the handicapped with Telesensory 
                            Systems before answering Job's call for an industrial designer after being out on his own for just
                            on a month.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Job's was adamant that the Apple II case should be made of plastic. He saw plastic symbolically as 
                            presenting the Apple II as a mass market object (as opposed to the other products that it would 
                            compete with at the next Computer Faire) bare circuit boards or rudimentary steel or wooden boxes.
