            <p>The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) revolutionised video gaming in the mid-late 1980s.</p>
            <p>
                With the rise of the personal computer, video games could now be played at home rather 
                than in the arcade. The Nintendo Corporation famously reestablished itself with the NES 
                after a crash in the video game market from 1983-85 by producing a new business model 
                for third-party developers. This was necessary due to the volumes of poorly made 'hacked'
                games that flooded the American market. This now-standard business made prevented this 
                hack-tivity and ensured that certain developers would only create games for the Nintendo 
                platform. The NES hit the markets in 1986 with certain modifications to iconic console's 
                predecessor, the Famicon.            
            </p>
            <p>
                There were several different ways that the NES control decks were packaged, sometimes 
                with only one game (the Basic Set retailing at $99.95), sometimes with promotional gear, 
                different controllers and multiple games (the Deluxe Set retailing at $199.95). The 
                object being collected is the Basic Set, containing the control deck, 2 controllers, and 
                the Super Mario Bros. cartridge. 
            </p>
            <p>Nintendo ceased the production of NES consoles in 1995.</p>

                            Australia (and Italy and the UK) via the Mattel Corporation in Great Britain.
                            Two versions of the NES were distributed in these PAL regions, the Mattel 
                            version (distributed between 1986 and 1990 by Mattel Corporation) and the 
                            NES version (distributed by Nintendo Corporation to these regions after 1990).

                            A video game console popular in the late 1980s for playing games on a 
                            television or monitor. It consists of a 2-tone grey and black console with 
                            red lettering. The console has 2-player capability with the controllers 
                            plugging in on the front right of the console. The game cartridge is loaded 
                            in the flip top section of the console and pressed down. Once a game is 
                            clicked into place, the power button on the front left of the console is 
                            pushed and the menu of the game appears onscreen. A reset button is also 
                            visible on the front of the console. The console connects to a television 
                            with red and yellow RCA cables or an RF connection. The box is ripped on 
                            the outside and there is an fluro orange sale sticker partially scratched 
                            off. One of the controllers isn't working and there is no manual included.
                        </p>

                            This particular NES console came to the Powerhouse Museum after a public 
                            call was generated for 'The 80s are back' exhibition of December 2009 - 
                            March 2011.
