# Website Rationale
## Rationale / Reflection
**Style / Theme / Aesthetic:**
\
\
The aesthetic I chose for the website is a mix of two different themes: firstly, vintage computers and terminal graphics; and secondly, vintage print media. The personality of this aesthetic is very ‘nostalgic’ which matches the items being showcased.

The colors consist of: cream, dark gray, yellow, red, and blue. The cream matches the look of both old print paper as well as the cream color of 80s and 90s computer cases. The dark gray was chosen to complement the cream color as black had too harsh a contrast. I find it hard to explain why the yellow, red, and blue strike me as nostalgic / vintage, but they are very similar to colors used in Star Trek or vintage matchbox design.

Font choice was kept to just two-ish: a terminal font sourced from google fonts (VT323) and a system font stack. The terminal font was used for headings whilst the system font stack was used for general paragraphs and content so it was easily readable.

I also used a random noise texture overlaid over the website that I felt gave it a nostalgic look, again for two main reasons: firstly, the texture gave it a print paper vibe; and secondly, it looks similar to film grain which is a common technique for evoking nostalgia, as it is like recalling a fading / fuzzy memory.

**Homepage:**

For the header, I decided to use the Powerhouse museum’s large logo / title text for two main reasons: firstly, to retain the Powerhouse museum’s brand identity; and secondly, because the website was too small for a top navigation section and I wanted to fill that space with something else.

The h1 text “Retro Computer Collection” used the terminal font (VT323) to convey the theme of the exhibit / collection. Additionally, a typewriter effect was added as a special feature to further convey the theme and to grab the attention of the user.

“The Collection” section header was deliberately positioned above the fold so users would know that there was more content below the header / hero section. Keeping with the computer terminal theme, the section header used the terminal font and had a primary color background and secondary color text.

The item sections were wrapped in brackets to reflect the influence of computer terminals and the images were halftoned with shapes of color to allude to old print media graphic design. These sections made use of the yellow, red, blue colors to differentiate themselves whilst also conveying the nostalgic and vintage personality of the website.

**Content Page:**

The content pages drew heavily from one specific inspiration: Gustavo Zambelli’s ‘Macindows’ art. The footer ties the website back to the Powerhouse museum.
## Low-Fidelity Prototypes

## Changes From Low-Fidelity Prototypes:

At first, I wanted to have a hero image (The PC with yellow band) right up at the top of the website. However, I found that this was too much detail fighting for the user’s attention upfront. I decided to just have the Powerhouse logo text and the special feature of the typewriter effect text which resulted in a much cleaner visual hierarchy.

For the item sections, I originally wanted to have a fieldset around each section that I made thicker with css. However, this resulted in a border that was either too thick or too thin and I didn’t think it would look good with color. I changed the design to brackets and moved the titles inside the sections. This allowed me to color the section headers independently of the border and, because the brackets didn’t wrap all the way around, it was far less intrusive / oppressive looking.

As for the content pages, I drew heavily from Gustavo Zambelli’s art.
